A while back, I spent a couple days moving off Spotify.

Main reason being, over time, they remove songs for various reasons (whether its licensing, copyright claims, artist issues, etc.), regardless of the reasons, it's gone.

This marked the final straw of my music streaming days. I'd much rather purchase albums, merch and concert tickets directly from the artists, instead of relying on Spotify for it all anyway.

If you already have a [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/personal-media-server/) configured, you can add a Music section to your library, and then listen with the specialized [PlexAmp](https://www.plex.tv/en-au/plexamp/) app on either your PC or Mobile, or directly through [app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv)

PlexAmp also supports Chromecast, Android Auto & Apple CarPlay which were mostly the features I was after when looking into open-sourced alternatives for this project.

## Setting up Plex

First create a Folder on your server (if you haven't already) to store your music, then Simply add a "New Library" in your Plex Server settings, and select "Music". Select the new folder for your library.

If you're using Docker, remember to add a mapping to your music library:

```yaml
services:
  plex:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest
    volumes:
      - ${MEDIA_DIR}/music:/music:ro
```

{{< /details >}}

{{< details summary="Add new Library" >}}
Settings ðŸ”§ > under "Manage" > "Libraries"

### Folder File Structure

You must follow a file structure similar to the below - There will be odd songs/albums/artists out depending on the state of the database, but generally everything will follow it:

## Moving from Spotify

**I moved away from Spotify by using [SpotDL]** - A [Python](https://www.python.org/) powered CLI tool for downloading music based off of Spotify.

It uses metadata from the [Spotify WebAPI](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and matches it up to [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/) for downloading.

```bash
pip install spotdl # --upgrade
```

There were a few things I needed to keep in mind:

1. Some Albums have multiple "CDs", which need to be accounted for in the [folder structure](#folder-file-structure), **as [SpotDL] has no way to automate this**.
2. Albums or Singles that have songs with more than 1 Artist, _typically_ need to go under a `Various Artists` folder in the root, instead of the artist folder itself.
3. Soundtracks for specific media (games, movies, etc.), also _usually_ go into `Various Artists`
4. [SpotDL] never downloads above 128kbps ([except w/ YT Premium](https://spotdl.github.io/spotify-downloader/usage/#youtube-music-premium))

Because of this, I couldn't just download entire Playlists at a time, because they _usually_ wouldn't sort properly.

The best combination I managed to pull off, was to download single Albums, by Artist `--output "{album-artist}/{album}/` one at a time. If that was too slow, I could also do entire Artists THEN manually move music as I find they need to be moved or renamed in my library.

You can still download by playlist or Spotify profile, but it's going to be **very messy** depending on how the song's album is structured, especially if the playlists consist of heaps of different artists and albums.

YouTube Premium users can use their account to download songs at a higher bitrate (256kbps) with `--bitrate disable` - [See how here](https://spotdl.github.io/spotify-downloader/usage/#youtube-music-premium)

```

#### Album (Various Artists)

```bash title="Album (Various Artists)"
spotdl download "https://open.spotify.com/album/..."  --output "Various Artists/{album}/{track-number} - {title}.{output-ext}" --save-errors error.log
```

#### Album (256kbps Bitrate)
